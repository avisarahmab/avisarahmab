### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi! I'm Avisa an aspiring **Data Analyst** and **Data Scientist** who enjoys turning data into insights and actions.  
I have experience in data analysis, visualization, and building predictive models using various tools and techniques.

I recently completed the **Full-Time Data Science Bootcamp at Hacktiv8**, covering topics such as **exploratory data analysis**, **forecasting**, and applied machine learning.  
Iâ€™ve also explored deep learning applications such as **natural language processing** and **computer vision** using neural networks like **ANN** and **CNN**.

I'm passionate about solving problems through data, continuously learning new skills, and collaborating with others.  
Always open to new connections and **excited to collaborate on meaningful data projects**!

Letâ€™s connect and explore how data can make a difference!
